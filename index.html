      <!-- App Description -->
      <h1>What does it do?</h1>
      <p>Tip tracker provides you with a simple way of tracking your spending on nights out, as we all know that feeling when you’re waiting on your next pay check to cover living costs after spending a little too much in a month.</p>

      <p>Tip Tracker provides 2 main capabilities:
        <ol>
          <li>Calculate exactly how much you should tip using the tip slider</li>
          <li>Fill in the details and save the receipt to your wallet for future reference</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>Keeping track of your dining expenditure will allow you to ensure you’re not overindulging, and see at a glance exactly how much you’ve spent lately.</p>

      <p>Enjoy the experience of dining out, knowing you’ll still have enough money to spend on the necessities at the end of the month.</p>

      <p class="small-font"><i>Please note, none of this is financial advice. We simply provide a tool to put you in control.</i></p>
